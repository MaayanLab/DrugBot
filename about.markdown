Recently, many biomedical research teams have moved to working and collaborating remotely, and consequently, online platforms that enable team communication have become increasingly popular. Among the most widely used platforms is Slack, a team communication tool and channel-based instant-messaging app. Users of Slack are able to customize their workspace by installing Slack applications. While many biomedical researchers use Slack for their day-to-day work, there are currently no applications geared towards this field available on the Slack application directory.

Here we present **DrugBot**, a Slack application for discovering knowledge about drugs directly within Slack. DrugBot listens to channel communication or slash commands to trigger the posting of information about single drugs or small molecules and drug sets. Drug sets are analyzed via enrichment analysis. Overall, DrugBot is a Slack application that enables Slack users to perform drug centered analyses directly within Slack.
