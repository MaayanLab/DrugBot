This privacy policy describes what data the Slack Application DrugBot collects, what it does with that data, and what choices the users have with respect to their data.

### What data does DrugBot collect?

DrugBot collects basic data about your workspace that allows it to authenticate you with Slack. This data is purged from our servers once you uninstall DrugBot.

DrugBot does not store user-submitted data. It only sends the anonymized genes and gene sets to three other applications to perform various analyses. The following are the applications that DrugBot interacts with:
- DrugEnrichr (https://maayanlab.cloud/DrugEnrichr/)
	- DrugEnrichr stores the anonymized drug sets to ensure that the enrichment analysis links are persistent
- L1000FWD (https://maayanlab.cloud/L1000FWD/)
- DrugBank (https://www.drugbank.ca)

L1000FWD and DrugBank do not save any submitted data.

### How does DrugBot use the data it saves?

DrugBot only stores basic data about your workspace to ensure it can authenticate you with Slack. User-submitted drugs and drug sets are anonymized and relayed to the other three applications listed above. Only one of these applications, namely DrugEnrichr, stores the submitted data to ensure persistent links. We will never sell, trade, or provide data collected from users to any outside parties.
